#' Rdrools
#' 
#' An interface for using the popular Java based Drools, which is a Business Rule Management System (See <https://www.drools.org> for more information).
#' This package allows data scientists to run rules on datasets provided through a CSV file using common data science verbs such as Filter, Group By and Aggregate.
#' Additionally, rules defined directly in the DRL format accepted by the Drools engine can also be run.
#' Credits to Mu Sigma for their continued support throughout the development of the package.
